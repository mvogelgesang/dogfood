Like many technology giants, the principle of \"eating your own dog food\" – where employees actively use the company's own products – has surfaced at various points, aiming to refine its offerings and align development with user needs. While perhaps not always as publicly broadcast as some competitors, instances of dogfooding at Yahoo provide a fascinating glimpse into its efforts to build better products from the inside out.\n\n**The Marissa Mayer Era: A Conscious Push for Internal Adoption**\n\nOne of the most prominent periods where dogfooding came to the forefront at Yahoo was during Marissa Mayer's tenure as CEO (2012-2017). Recognizing the importance of employees experiencing products just as users would, several initiatives were launched:\n\n* **The Yahoo Mail Mandate:** In 2013, a notable internal push occurred, urging Yahoo employees to switch from other email clients, like Microsoft Outlook, to Yahoo Mail for their corporate communications. An [internal memo, reported by All Things Digital and discussed on Slashdot](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/11/25/2355218/only-25-of-yahoo-staff-eat-their-own-dog-food), revealed that adoption wasn't instantaneous, with reports suggesting around 25% of staff had made the switch at one point. This highlighted both a commitment to dogfooding core products and the inherent challenges in changing established employee workflows. The goal was clear: if Yahoo's own workforce used its flagship email service daily, they would be the first to spot issues, suggest improvements, and understand its strengths and weaknesses.\n\n* **\"Smart Phones, Smart Fun!\": Aligning with User Devices:** A significant dogfooding initiative under Mayer was the \"Smart Phones, Smart Fun!\" program, launched in 2012. As reported by [ZDNET](https://www.zdnet.com/article/yahoo-ceo-have-a-smartphone-on-us-but-no-blackberrys/), Yahoo offered to buy its employees popular smartphones of the time (like iPhones and Android devices), while strategically moving away from BlackBerrys as corporate phones. Mayer's reasoning, outlined in a memo, was direct: \"Ideally, we'd like our employees to have devices similar to our users, so we can think and work as the majority of our users do.\" This was a direct investment in ensuring that the teams building and testing Yahoo's mobile experiences were doing so on the very platforms their end-users were on, leading to more relevant and effective product development.\n\nThese examples from the Mayer era demonstrate a top-down drive to embed dogfooding principles into the company culture, aiming to make employees the first line of defense in quality assurance and a crucial source of experiential feedback.\n\n**Beyond Mandates: A Culture of Iteration and Experimentation**\n\nWhile large-scale, company-wide dogfooding mandates capture headlines, the practice also exists in more nuanced forms within product development teams. Modern software development, particularly in large tech organizations like Yahoo, relies heavily on iterative cycles, A/B testing, and continuous feedback.\n\nJob descriptions for roles within Yahoo's product and engineering teams, for instance, often highlight the importance of data-driven design, experimentation, and collaboration. Product Managers and Designers working on an application like Yahoo Mail or Yahoo News are, by the nature of their roles, constantly using and evaluating the product. They are involved in:\n\n* Testing new features in development environments.\n* Participating in internal pilots or beta programs before wider release.\n* Analyzing user behavior (which would include their own and their colleagues' interactions during tests) to inform design choices.\n\nThis ongoing, embedded form of dogfooding is crucial for catching bugs, usability issues, and ensuring features meet their intended goals.\n\n**Challenges and Evolution**\n\nThe path of dogfooding isn't always smooth. As seen with the Yahoo Mail example, internal resistance or preference for alternative tools can be a hurdle. Employees, like any users, value productivity and might be hesitant to switch to a product, even an internal one, if they perceive it as less efficient for their tasks.\n\nFurthermore, for a company with as diverse a product suite as Yahoo (Search, Finance, Sports, etc.), ensuring consistent and effective dogfooding across all areas presents a complex challenge. The \"target user\" for Yahoo Finance might have different needs and expectations than a casual user of Yahoo Search, making a one-size-fits-all dogfooding strategy difficult.\n\nSince its acquisition by Verizon and subsequent sale to Apollo Global Management, Yahoo's internal operational details, including specific current dogfooding programs, are less publicly discussed. However, the foundational principles of testing, user-centric design, and iterative improvement common in the tech industry suggest that internal usage and feedback mechanisms remain important, even if they evolve in their implementation.\n\n**Why It Matters for a Giant Like Yahoo**\n\nFor a company that has touched billions of internet users, dogfooding offers significant advantages:\n\n* **Early Issue Detection:** Finding and fixing bugs and usability problems before they impact the public is invaluable.\n* **User Empathy:** Employees gain a deeper understanding of the user experience, leading to more intuitive and thoughtful product design.\n* **Faster Innovation:** Direct feedback loops can accelerate the development and refinement of new features.\n* **Building Confidence:** When a company's own employees actively use and stand by its products, it sends a powerful message, both internally and externally.\n\nYahoo's journey with dogfooding, marked by explicit initiatives and the inherent practices of modern development, underscores a long-standing tech industry truth: to build products that users love, it often helps to be your own most critical first customer. While the methods and intensity may change with time and leadership, the core idea of looking inward to improve outward-facing products remains a vital part of the tech playbook.","excerpt":"How did (and does) Yahoo, a pioneering internet company, use its own products internally?

With a mission so deeply intertwined with user well-being and relationship dynamics, one might wonder: how does Bumble ensure its features truly resonate and function as intended? A key practice in the tech world is \"dogfooding\"—where employees actively use their own products. But does the team at Bumble swipe right (or left) on internal, pre-release versions of their own app?\n\nWhile Bumble isn't as public about its specific internal dogfooding programs for the core dating app as some other tech companies, a look at their product development philosophy, emphasis on safety, and testing of new features provides clues into how they might \"eat their own dog food.\"\n\n## A Culture Steeped in User Experience and Safety\n\nFrom its inception, Bumble has differentiated itself by putting women's experiences at the forefront. As highlighted by [Austin Monthly](https://www.austinmonthly.com/as-people-pivot-from-dating-apps-bumble-looks-to-reinvent-itself/), their Chief Legal Officer, Elizabeth Monteleone, stated, “We design and build all our products through a women's lens... Our belief is that when you make technology better for women, you make it better for everyone.” This core philosophy suggests a deep internal commitment to understanding and refining the user journey. Such a commitment is a natural precursor to effective dogfooding, where employees would be encouraged to view the app critically from a user's perspective.\n\nBumble's values, as listed on their [About Us page](https://bumble.com/about/), champion \"integrity, kindness, equality, confidence, and respect.\" A company culture built on these principles would ideally foster an environment where employees feel empowered to provide candid feedback on their own products—a cornerstone of successful dogfooding.\n\n## Evidence of Internal Testing: AI and Safety Features\n\nWhile broad-based employee dogfooding of the entire app experience isn't heavily publicized, there are instances where internal testing of specific features is mentioned. A [Mashable article](https://mashable.com/article/comparing-ai-features-tinder-hinge-bumble) discussing AI in dating apps notes that Bumble's \"Deception Detector,\" an AI tool to block spam, scam, or fake profiles, was found to block 95% of identified offending profiles \"according to internal testing.\"\n\nSimilarly, Bumble's \"Are You Sure? (AYS)\" feature, which scans messages for potentially harmful language and prompts senders to reconsider, underwent \"early testing\" that demonstrated a more than 10% reduction in inappropriate language. These examples confirm that Bumble does conduct internal testing to validate the effectiveness and impact of new technologies before they are rolled out to millions of users. This targeted internal testing is a crucial form of dogfooding, even if it's focused on specific components rather than the entire app experience for all employees.\n\n## Early Roots in Direct User Feedback\n\nBumble's commitment to feedback loops was evident even in its early growth. An article on [AlexanderJarvis.com titled \"Bumble doing things that don't scale\"](https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/bumble-doing-things-that-dont-scale/) details how founder Whitney Wolfe Herd initially used campus ambassadors to build the user base. These ambassadors \"provided valuable feedback to the Bumble team, reporting on how the app was being received, what features users wanted, and what concerns needed to be addressed.\" This direct line to early users, while not traditional employee dogfooding, established a foundational practice of iterative development based on real-world experience.\n\n## The Unique Challenges and Opportunities of Dogfooding a Dating App\n\nDogfooding a dating app like Bumble presents unique considerations that differ from dogfooding, say, productivity software:\n\n* **Personal vs. Professional:** Employees using a dating app for testing might blur the lines between their professional responsibilities and personal lives. Privacy is a significant concern.\n* **Representative User Base:** Are employees, particularly those in tech hubs, representative of Bumble's diverse global user base? Dating preferences, cultural norms, and user needs can vary wildly. An \"echo chamber effect,\" as mentioned in a [Splunk blog post on dogfooding](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/dogfooding.html), could be a risk if the internal testing pool isn't diverse.\n* **Emotional Aspect:** Dating is an inherently emotional experience. Employee feedback might be influenced by personal dating successes or frustrations, which could be valuable but also needs to be interpreted carefully.\n* **Feature Saturation:** As with any mature app, employees who are long-term users might become overly familiar with existing features and workflows, potentially missing usability issues that a new user might encounter. [Instabug's blog on dogfooding risks](https://www.instabug.com/blog/the-risks-of-dogfooding-and-when-not-to-dogfood/) highlights this \"increased familiarity\" as a common challenge.\n\nHowever, the opportunities are also significant. Employees who are actively using the app to find connections can offer incredibly insightful feedback on everything from profile creation to matching algorithms and conversation tools. They can experience firsthand the impact of Bumble's safety features and its unique \"women make the first move\" dynamic.\n\n## The Unseen Swipes\n\nWhile Bumble may not shout about its internal dogfooding programs from the rooftops, its strong focus on user safety, its \"women-first\" design philosophy, and its documented internal testing of critical AI-driven features suggest a company that deeply values product quality and user experience. It's highly probable that a combination of targeted internal testing, dedicated QA teams, and robust user feedback mechanisms (perhaps even including some level of broader, informal employee usage) all contribute to the app's ongoing refinement.\n\nThe true extent to which Bumble employees are \"living the product\" in a formal dogfooding capacity remains somewhat opaque. However, for an app centered on human connection and safety, ensuring their own hive is buzzing with positive experiences would be a logical step in building a better platform for everyone.","excerpt":"Bumble's mission is to create a platform built on safety, kindness, and empowering women.

For Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, this involves a crucial, though famously guarded, practice: \"eating your own dog food.\" While the specifics are often shrouded in secrecy, it's known that Snap employees actively test and use unreleased versions of Snapchat, a process vital for refining features before they reach millions of users worldwide.\n\n## The Internal Lens: Dogfooding at Snap\n\nLike many tech giants, Snap leverages its own workforce as a first line of defense against bugs and a source of invaluable feedback on new features. As [Business Insider Africa reported](https://africa.businessinsider.com/tech/tech-this-is-how-snapchat-keeps-employees-from-leaking-new-features-before-product/pb59b8l.amp), Snap maintains a strong culture of secrecy around its product development. This extends to its dogfooding practices, where access to internal, pre-release features is tightly controlled, even among its own staff, to prevent leaks. When employees do get access to these builds, they are often met with warning messages, underscoring the confidential nature of this early testing.\n\nThis internal usage allows Snap to:\n* **Identify and Fix Bugs Early:** Employees using the app in their daily lives can uncover issues in real-world scenarios that automated testing might miss.\n* **Gauge Feature Usability:** Internal teams can provide immediate feedback on how intuitive or cumbersome new functionalities are.\n* **Foster a Sense of Ownership:** When employees use and critique the product they're building, it can lead to a stronger sense of ownership and a drive for higher quality.\n\nWhile detailed public accounts of specific features born directly from employee-only dogfooding are scarce due to this secrecy, the practice is an undeniable component of their development cycle.\n\n## Beyond the Yellow Ghost: Public Beta Programs\n\nSupplementing its internal efforts, Snapchat also runs a **public beta program**. This allows enthusiastic users, or \"real bug hunters\" as [Snapchat Support](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012385255188-How-do-I-join-Snapchat-s-Beta-Program) calls them, to test new Snapchat features before they're widely available. Platforms like [TestingCatalog](https://www.testingcatalog.com/snapchat-beta/) provide insights into how users can join these beta programs for both Android and iOS (via TestFlight).\n\nA key feature for beta testers is **\"Shake to Report,\"** which is enabled by default. This simple gesture allows testers to quickly report bugs or make suggestions, streamlining the feedback process directly within the app. This broader user testing helps Snap gather diverse perspectives and identify issues across a wider range of devices and usage patterns than internal testing alone might cover.\n\n## Cultivating Innovation: The Snap Culture\n\nSnap's company culture, which emphasizes being \"Kind, Smart \u0026 Creative,\" also plays a role in fostering an environment where product iteration can thrive. A unique, if somewhat unconventional, example is the **\"presentation test\"** revealed by CEO Evan Spiegel, as reported by [SightsIn Plus](https://sightsinplus.com/news/employment/snapchat-ceo-introduces-presentation-test-for-new-hires/). New hires, particularly designers, are challenged on their first day to present a novel idea without prior company context. Spiegel’s rationale is that \"Ninety-nine percent of ideas are not good — but 1% is... And the best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.\"\n\nWhile not direct product dogfooding, this practice encourages creative thinking, risk-taking, and an acceptance of initial \"failure\" as part of the innovation process. Such a mindset is crucial for a successful dogfooding culture, where employees need to feel empowered to critique and suggest radical changes to the product.\n\n## When Feedback Loops Falter: The 2018 Redesign\n\nNo company gets it right every time, and Snap is no exception. The controversial Snapchat redesign rolled out in February 2018 serves as a significant case study. This update, which aimed to separate friend content from publisher content, was met with widespread user backlash, negatively impacting user satisfaction and even leading to a decline in app store ratings, as documented in research hosted on [ScholarSpace by the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstreams/5bf163e1-b1a3-4bf7-a0c8-83d952cb667d/download).\n\nWhile it's difficult to say from the outside how extensively this specific redesign was dogfooded internally or what the internal feedback was, the public reaction underscored a critical point: even with internal testing, misalignment with broader user expectations can occur. Some analyses, like one on [DEXA](https://learnwithdexa.com/5-13-practical-activity-product-mgt-course-learning-from-snapchats-failure/), suggest the redesign may have been rushed and lacked sufficient *external* user feedback and clear communication before launch. This highlights that dogfooding, while valuable, is most effective when part of a larger strategy that includes diverse user research and phased rollouts for major changes. It serves as a reminder that internal employee perspectives, while crucial, may not always mirror the entire user base.\n\n## The Way Forward: Iteration and User Focus\n\nSnapchat's journey with dogfooding is a blend of secretive internal testing and more open public beta programs. The company’s emphasis on innovation and a creative culture encourages employees to think like users and contribute to the product's evolution. Feedback mechanisms are built into the app, facilitating a flow of information from testers back to the development teams.\n\nWhile the infamous 2018 redesign shows that even diligent internal processes don't guarantee a universally loved outcome, the practice of \"eating your own dog food\" remains a cornerstone of how tech companies like Snap strive to build better, more engaging products. By continuously using and critiquing Snapchat from within, Snap employees play a vital, if often unseen, role in shaping the platform for its millions of users globally.","excerpt":"Snapchat is renowned for its innovative and rapidly evolving features.

It’s the simple yet powerful idea that companies should use their own products internally. This isn't just about quality assurance; it's about deeply understanding the user experience, fostering innovation, and building better solutions. Ride-sharing and delivery giant Uber is no stranger to this philosophy, employing various forms of dogfooding across its vast technological landscape.\n\nWhile specific, company-wide programs for employees to exclusively use beta versions of the core Rider app for daily activities aren't always publicly detailed, Uber's approach to internal software use and product iteration reveals a strong culture of testing, feedback, and in-house tool reliance.\n\n## Riding on Experimentation: The Experimentation Platform (XP)\n\nAt the heart of Uber's product evolution is its sophisticated **Experimentation Platform (XP)**. As detailed on the [Uber Blog (\"Under the Hood of Uber's Experimentation Platform\")](https://www.uber.com/blog/xp/), this in-house system is pivotal for testing new features, design changes, and even machine learning models across all of Uber's applications – Rider, Driver, Eats, and Freight. XP allows engineers and data scientists to run over 1,000 experiments concurrently, employing A/B/N testing, causal inference, and more.\n\nBefore launching the completely redesigned Driver app, for instance, it \"went through extensive hypothesis testings through a series of experiments conducted with our XP.\" This platform ensures that changes are data-driven and validated with real users (which can, and often do, include Uber employees themselves) before being rolled out broadly. While this is more akin to large-scale, controlled beta testing than traditional dogfooding of unstable builds by all employees, it’s a critical part of their iterative process. More recently, Uber has continued to invest in this area, [making their experiment evaluation engine 100x faster](https://www.uber.com/blog/making-ubers-experiment-evaluation-engine-100x-faster/), showcasing their commitment to rapid, data-backed iteration.\n\n## Building with Drivers, For Drivers: The New Driver App Beta\n\nA stellar example of targeted dogfooding and user-centric design at Uber was the development of their new Driver app. According to an [Uber Blog post (\"Let's build together: the story behind the new Driver app\")](https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/building-together-driver-app-ca/), the company didn't just rely on internal teams. They engaged over **400 drivers and delivery partners across 7 cities worldwide** in a unique Beta program.\n\nThese weren't just passive testers. Participants actively collaborated with Uber designers and engineers, providing ideas, sharing feedback, and reporting bugs. As Uber engineer Haider noted, \"A typical Beta wasn't going to cut it for us...We truly had to understand how the app performed in various cities and in different circumstances for different drivers and delivery partners.\" Drivers like Eva highlighted the value of being heard: \"Just the fact that I was heard and my opinion mattered was huge.\" This deep collaboration, including Uber employees doing ride-alongs, allowed the team to identify and fix issues, like improving the visibility of surge pricing on the map, based directly on the experiences of those who use the app to earn their livelihood. Over 16 weeks, these beta testers reported over 2,600 bugs, a testament to the power of real-world use.\n\n## Internal Tools Get the Dogfood Treatment Too\n\nUber doesn't just dogfood its main user-facing apps; its internal tools are also built and refined through self-use.\n\n* **uRate:** To streamline feedback collection, Uber developed **uRate**, an internal platform described on the [Uber Blog (\"Thank You for Your Feedback: Improving the Uber Engineering Workflow with uRate\")](https://www.uber.com/blog/urate/). This tool allows Uber employees (and potentially external users in some contexts) to provide instant feedback on various Uber tools and products. The uRate widget can be integrated into any internal application, enabling employees to report bugs, suggest features, or simply rate their experience. This creates a direct and continuous feedback loop, ensuring internal tools are as efficient and user-friendly as possible. For example, after embedding uRate into their internal \"Whober\" employee portal, the team quickly identified a common request for more searchable user fields based on the feedback received.\n\n* **COTA (Customer Obsession Ticket Assistant):** Uber's customer support operations are enhanced by COTA, an in-house developed tool that uses machine learning and natural language processing to help agents resolve issues more efficiently. As detailed in blog posts about [COTA's initial development](https://www.uber.com/blog/cota/) and its [scaling with deep learning (COTA v2)](https://www.uber.com/blog/cota-v2/), this system is used daily by Uber's support team. The insights gained from this internal usage directly fueled its iterations and improvements, reducing ticket resolution times by over 10% while maintaining or improving customer satisfaction. This is a clear case of dogfooding a critical internal system to enhance operational efficiency and, ultimately, the customer experience.\n\n* **Devpod:** Even the tools used by Uber's developers are dogfooded. **Devpod**, Uber's remote development environment, was created to boost engineering productivity. According to the [Uber Blog (\"Devpod: Improving Developer Productivity at Uber with Remote Development\")](https://www.uber.com/blog/devpod-improving-developer-productivity-at-uber/), internal Net Promoter Score (NPS) feedback from Uber developers consistently identifies Devpod as a major productivity booster. This internal usage and feedback cycle helps the Devpod team refine the tool, addressing everything from IDE experience to cost efficiency.\n\n## The Unspoken Expectation and Potential Pitfalls\n\nBeyond formal programs, there's often an implicit expectation in tech companies that employees will be regular users of their own services. As one [Bubble.io blog post on dogfooding](https://bubble.io/blog/dogfooding-startup-tech/) suggests, \"Uber employees should regularly use Uber to get to and from the office.\" This day-to-day usage naturally leads to employees experiencing the product just as any customer would, spotting pain points, and ideating improvements.\n\nHowever, relying solely on internal software can sometimes lead companies astray, especially if the employee base isn't representative of the broader user population or if the tools are used for purposes beyond ethical product improvement. An example of Uber's internally developed software leading to controversy was the \"Hell\" program, reported by [GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/report-uber-used-secret-hell-software-track-drivers-competitor-lyft/) and others. This software was allegedly used between 2014 and 2016 to track drivers working for competitor Lyft, reportedly to gain a competitive advantage by luring them away. While it demonstrates Uber's capability in building and deploying its own software solutions, it also serves as a stark reminder that dogfooding's positive intent can be overshadowed if the application of internal technology isn't guided by strong ethical principles.\n\n## Conclusion: A Culture of Iteration and Internal Reliance\n\nUber's approach to software development is deeply intertwined with the practice of using its own solutions. From the rigorous A/B testing managed by its Experimentation Platform to the collaborative beta program for the new Driver app and the continuous refinement of internal tools like uRate, COTA, and Devpod, Uber leverages its own technology to learn, iterate, and enhance its offerings.\n\nThis internal reliance fosters a deep understanding of their products' strengths and weaknesses. While the path of dogfooding isn't without its potential for missteps, Uber’s commitment to building and using its own tools is a significant driver in its continuous push for innovation and an improved user experience for riders, drivers, eaters, and its own employees.","excerpt":"Uber leverages its own technology extensively, from sophisticated experimentation platforms to internal tools and targeted beta programs. This post explores how dogfooding—using their own products—helps Uber innovate, refine, and occasionally, stumble.","tags":["dogfooding","software development","uber","product development","beta testing","internal tools","experimentation","agile"]},{"slug":"googlers-first","title":"Googlers First: How Google Dogfoods Its Own Search Engine to Shape Our Queries","date":"2025-05-08","content":"\nFor billions of people, Google Search is the primary tool for navigating the vast expanse of the internet. Its seemingly simple interface belies an incredibly complex machinery of algorithms and features that are constantly being refined. A crucial, though often behind-the-scenes, part of this refinement process at Google is \"dogfooding\"—the practice of employees intensively using their own products before they are released to the public. This isn't just a casual trial; it's a deeply ingrained part of Google's culture aimed at catching bugs, improving usability, and ensuring new developments meet the high standards expected of its flagship product.\n\n## A Long-Standing Culture of \"Eating Your Own Dog Food\"\n\nThe term \"dogfooding\" in the tech world refers to a company using its own products internally. Google has a long and well-documented history of this practice across its suite of services. As noted in various industry analyses and books like Laszlo Bock's \"Work Rules!\", which offers insights into Google's internal culture, Googlers are often the first real users of new products and features. This allows for open feedback based on practical, daily use, helping teams iterate and improve.\n\nWhile Gmail is a classic example of a Google product extensively dogfooded to success, the same philosophy applies to its core service: Google Search. As [Ashutosh Gupta, a Director at Google, stated in a Google Cloud blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/consulting/how-google-cloud-consulting-uses-ai-to-serve-customers-better), \"At Google, we have a strong culture of dogfooding products — using and testing them internally to improve the experience for our own teams and customers.\"\n\n## How Googlers Test Search: From Daily Use to \"AI Mode\"\n\nDogfooding Google Search can take several forms:\n\n* **Everyday Usage:** Google employees, being information workers, are inherently heavy users of search engines. This daily reliance on their own product naturally uncovers quirks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.\n* **\"Dogfood Builds\":** As commonly understood in software development and [noted on platforms like Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34810674/what-is-the-dogfood-build), companies like Google create \"dogfood builds.\" These are internal, pre-release versions of software that contain new, often experimental, features. These versions might be less stable but are crucial for real-world testing by employees.\n* **Structured Testing of New Features:** A prime recent example is Google's internal testing of a new **\"AI Mode\" for Search**. [Reports from early 2025 via Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-search-ai-mode-leaked-3523910/) and [Slashdot](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/06/2354244/google-tests-ai-powered-search-mode-with-employees) detailed how Google employees were invited to test this feature, powered by a custom version of its Gemini AI model. This AI Mode aims to provide a more conversational search experience for complex, exploratory queries. Leaked internal communications even showed a new \"AI Mode\" chip appearing alongside existing search filters, with a chat interface for answers and follow-up questions. This is dogfooding in action – putting a significant new Search paradigm through its paces internally before any wider public beta.\n\n## Feedback Mechanisms: More Than Just Casual Chatter\n\nWhile the exact internal tools are proprietary, it's clear Google has mechanisms for employees to report their findings. Anecdotal evidence, such as a [2018 report from Search Engine Roundtable](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-dogfood-feedback-25696.html) about \"Dogfood feedback\" links accidentally appearing to non-Googlers, hints at structured feedback channels like internal forms. General best practices for dogfooding, as outlined by resources like [Learning Loop](https://learningloop.io/plays/dogfooding), often involve dedicated Slack channels, issue trackers (Google has its own, like Issue Tracker, which is also partially public), or embedded feedback forms within the dogfood versions themselves. This ensures that the valuable insights gained from internal use are captured, categorized, and funneled back to the relevant development teams.\n\n## Part of a Broader Quality Ecosystem\n\nIt's important to note that dogfooding is just one component of Google's comprehensive approach to Search quality. As detailed on Google's \"How Search Works\" website, changes to Search undergo a rigorous evaluation process. In 2023 alone, Google ran thousands of launches, tens of thousands of live traffic experiments, hundreds of thousands of search quality tests (often involving external Search Quality Raters who use detailed guidelines), and a similar number of side-by-side experiments.\n\nEmployee dogfooding provides a unique, early perspective from users who have deep context about the company and its products. This internal feedback complements the data-driven insights from live experiments and the evaluations from external raters, contributing to a holistic view of a feature's potential impact and quality.\n\n## The Challenges of Dogfooding at Scale\n\nEven for a company like Google, dogfooding isn't without its challenges, especially for a product as ubiquitous and diverse as Search:\n\n* **Representativeness:** Google employees, while numerous, may not perfectly represent the entirety of Google's global user base in terms of technical savvy, search needs, cultural contexts, or access to technology. This is a common dogfooding pitfall highlighted by Jeff Atwood in a [Coding Horror blog post](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-difficulty-of-dogfooding/).\n* **The \"Expert User\" Bias:** Employees, particularly engineers, might be \"expert users\" who can easily navigate complex interfaces or work around bugs that would frustrate an average user.\n* **Maintaining Objectivity:** It can sometimes be challenging for employees to provide truly unbiased feedback on products they are deeply involved in creating.\n\nGoogle is likely aware of these challenges and mitigates them by combining dogfooding with other diverse testing methodologies.\n\n## Shaping the Future of Search from Within\n\nGoogle's commitment to dogfooding its Search engine means that many of the features and refinements we experience as end-users have already been put through their paces by thousands of Googlers. From incremental improvements to significant new paradigms like AI-powered search, internal testing plays a vital role in ensuring that Google Search continues to evolve. While the \"dogfood\" might occasionally be a bit \"buggy\" for internal testers, their efforts are a key ingredient in Google's recipe for maintaining its position as the world's leading search engine. The next time you type a query, remember that a Googler probably searched it first.","excerpt":"Google Search is the gateway to the internet for billions. But before new features or algorithm tweaks reach the public, they often go through rigorous internal testing by Google's own employees—a practice known as 'dogfooding.' This post explores how Google eats its own search dog food to refine the world's most popular search engine.","tags":["dogfooding","google search","google","software development","product development","beta testing","search engine","innovation","company culture","AI in search"]},{"slug":"etsys-secret-sauce","title":"Etsy's Secret Sauce: How 'Eating Their Own Dog Food' Fuels a Better Marketplace","date":"2025-05-08","content":"\nIn the fast-paced world of software development, there's a time-honored practice that often separates good products from great ones: \"eating your own dog food,\" or dogfooding. It's the simple yet profound idea that companies should use their own products and services internally as a primary way to test, understand, and improve them. Etsy, the sprawling online marketplace for handcrafted and vintage items, has woven this philosophy into its development culture, leading to a more robust and user-centric platform.\n\nWhile Etsy might not always shout \"dogfooding\" from the rooftops with a formal, branded program name, the principles are evident in their engineering practices, product rollout strategies, and company culture. They understand that to truly serve their vibrant community of millions of sellers and buyers, their own teams need to be deeply familiar with the platform's every nook and cranny – experiencing both its triumphs and its frustrations firsthand.\n\n**Early and Continuous Internal Use: The Mobile App Example**\n\nOne of the clearest illustrations of Etsy's dogfooding commitment comes from its approach to mobile app development. As far back as 2014, reports highlighted how Etsy leveraged continuous integration principles not just for their web stack, but rigorously for their mobile applications as well. Instead of solely relying on external beta testers, Etsy would roll out continuous releases of its mobile apps to internal teams. This meant that Etsy employees were among the very first to use new features and iterations in real-world scenarios.\n\nTo facilitate this internal feedback loop, Etsy even developed tools like an internal \"Bug Hunting tool.\" This allowed employees to report bugs directly from their devices, often attaching screenshots to pinpoint issues. Adding a touch of fun and engagement, there was even a level of gamification, with leaderboards recognizing the most prolific bug hunters. This approach not only helped in identifying and fixing bugs early but also fostered a sense of collective ownership and quality assurance across the company.\n\n**A Culture of Experimentation: Dogfooding at Scale**\n\nEtsy is renowned for its deeply ingrained culture of experimentation, particularly its extensive use of A/B testing. As detailed on their \"Code as Craft\" engineering blog and in various discussions by their product teams, nearly every change, from a button color to a new search algorithm, is often tested with a subset of users before a full rollout.\n\nWhile A/B testing isn't dogfooding in its purest, most isolated form (where only employees use a pre-release version), it functions as a type of scaled dogfooding in Etsy's context. Employees, being active users of the platform for their own shopping or even as sellers themselves, are inevitably part of these experiment groups. They experience new features organically, providing an invaluable layer of sophisticated, internal \"first users\" before changes reach the entire user base.\n\nThis continuous experimentation allows Etsy to:\n\n* **Gather Real-World Data:** See how new features perform under actual usage conditions.\n* **Validate Hypotheses:** Test assumptions about user behavior and preferences.\n* **Iterate Rapidly:** Make data-driven decisions and refine features quickly.\n\nEtsy's \"Building Better Tools With Experiments\" guide for sellers even explains this philosophy, stating, \"By testing new features with a small percentage of Etsy users, we gather valuable data that helps us ensure that the changes we make will have a positive impact for the majority of Etsy sellers.\" Employees are a critical, albeit often undifferentiated, part of that \"small percentage.\"\n\n**Encouraging Company-Wide Product Immersion**\n\nBeyond formal testing, there's a cultural expectation at Etsy that encourages employees to engage deeply with the product. Cap Watkins, a former VP of Design at Etsy, articulated this well in a blog post about his design process. He emphasized the importance of company-wide dogfooding during development:\n\n\u003e Hopefully you've already had your entire company dog-fooding your new release during development. If not, it's time. Get everyone to use your product under real, live conditions. Gather feedback. Make adjustments.\n\n[Cap Watkins, _My Design Process Part 3_](https://capwatkins.com/blog/my-design-process-part-3)\n\nThis sentiment underscores a proactive approach to getting the product in front of internal users. It’s about more than just QA; it’s about fostering empathy and ensuring that everyone, from engineers to marketers, understands the user experience from the inside out. When employees are encouraged to use the platform for their personal shopping, or if they run their own small shops, they naturally become critical and insightful testers of new seller tools and buyer-facing features.\n\n**Focus on Seller Success: Internal Testing for a Better Toolkit**\n\nEtsy's success is inextricably linked to the success of its sellers. Therefore, a significant portion of their development effort goes into creating and refining tools for shop owners. Recent pushes to enhance the Shop Manager dashboard, introduce AI-powered listing assistance, and provide real-time feedback on listing quality are prime examples.\n\nWhile Etsy often beta tests these new seller features with \"a select group of sellers,\" it's highly probable that employees who also run Etsy shops, or dedicated internal testing accounts, are among these early adopters. This allows Etsy to:\n\n* **Understand Seller Pain Points:** Internal users can quickly identify clunky workflows or missing functionalities in new seller tools.\n* **Refine Usability:** Ensure that new features are intuitive and genuinely helpful before a wider release.\n* **Catch Edge Cases:** Discover unique scenarios or problems that might not be apparent in controlled testing environments.\n\n**The Nuances and Potential Pitfalls**\n\nDogfooding, for all its benefits, isn't a silver bullet. One potential challenge is the \"expert user\" syndrome. Employees who are intimately familiar with the platform's architecture and upcoming features might not use the product in the same way a brand-new, less technically savvy user would. They might unconsciously work around bugs or understand convoluted features that would baffle an average customer. Etsy mitigates this through its extensive A/B testing with broader audiences and dedicated user research.\n\nAnother aspect is ensuring that feedback channels are open and that employees feel empowered to provide honest, critical feedback without fear of reprisal. Etsy's engineering culture, which emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and empowering developers, seems conducive to fostering such an environment.\n\n**Conclusion: A Living Lab for a Thriving Marketplace**\n\nEtsy's application of dogfooding principles, whether through direct internal releases, widespread experimentation, or a culture of product immersion, plays a crucial role in its continuous improvement. By having its own team members regularly use and scrutinize the platform, Etsy gains invaluable insights, catches issues earlier, and ultimately builds a more resilient, user-friendly, and innovative marketplace.\n\nIt’s this commitment to living within their own creation, to experiencing what their buyers and sellers experience, that helps Etsy \"Keep Commerce Human\" – not just as a tagline, but as a practiced reality in their product development lifecycle. While they may not always use the term \"dogfooding,\" their actions speak volumes, demonstrating a clear understanding that the path to a better product often starts by looking inward.","excerpt":"Etsy, the global marketplace for unique and creative goods, doesn't just build tools for its millions of sellers and buyers; they immerse themselves in their own ecosystem.
