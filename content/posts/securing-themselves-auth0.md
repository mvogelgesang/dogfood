excerpt: "Auth0, now a product unit within Okta, doesn't just sell identity solutions; it lives by them. This post explores how Auth0's practice of using its own platform for internal authentication, API security, and developer tooling has driven product innovation like the 'Teams' feature, while also examining the complexities and criticisms that can arise when a company is its own first customer."

For a company built on providing robust and scalable identity and access management (IAM), the ultimate proving ground is often its own internal infrastructure and workforce. Auth0, now a key product unit within Okta, has long embraced the principle of using its own platform to secure its applications, manage employee access, and empower its developers. This deep internal reliance on its own technology has been a significant driver for product innovation and refinement, though not without the inherent complexities that arise when a company's internal needs intersect with a diverse global customer base.

### Building with Their Own Blocks: From APIs to "Teams"

Auth0's architecture is fundamentally API-first. This means that the comprehensive set of Authentication and Management APIs they provide to customers are the same ones their internal teams leverage to build and secure Auth0's own services and administrative dashboards ([Digital Marketplace, "Okta - Auth0 - Identity Management Platform"](https://www.applytosupply.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/793836677921733)). This approach ensures that their APIs are not just theoretical constructs but are continuously battle-tested and refined through real-world, mission-critical internal applications. When Auth0 engineers develop new SDKs, like the `auth0-fastify-api` SDK for securing Fastify APIs, they are creating tools that their own colleagues might use, fostering a strong emphasis on developer experience and ease of integration ([Auth0 Blog, "Announcing the Auth0 Fastify API SDK"](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-fastify-sdk/)).

A prime example of this internal-first innovation is the "Teams" feature. Auth0 explicitly describes "Teams" – a platform layer designed to simplify the management of multiple Auth0 tenants and tenant members – as a "perfect example of ‘dogfooding’, the practice of using one's own products or services." ([Auth0 Blog, "Auth0 by Okta: Teams"](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-by-okta-teams/)). This feature was built upon Auth0's existing "Organizations" capability, which itself serves B2B customers. By addressing their own internal needs for better tenant visibility and collaborative management, Auth0 developed a solution that directly translates to improved usability and control for their customers managing complex, multi-environment deployments.

Auth0's commitment to security best practices, such as robust multi-factor authentication (MFA), breached password detection, and secure token handling, is not just advice for its customers; it's integral to how they protect their own platform and employee access ([AppSecure, "Secure Your Auth0 Authentication"](https://www.appsecure.security/blog/auth0-best-security-practices), [DeepStrike, "Auth0 Security Best Practices"](https://deepstrike.io/blog/auth0-security-best-practices)). When employees access internal systems or the Auth0 management dashboard itself, they are interacting with the same security layers and protocols that their customers rely on.

### Guiding Principles for SDKs: Learning from Internal Use

The internal use of their own SDKs and APIs naturally informs Auth0's "Guiding Principles for Building SDKs." Emphasizing empathy for the developer, providing intuitive experiences, and minimizing friction are key tenets ([Auth0 Blog, "Guiding Principles for Building SDKs"](https://auth0.com/blog/guiding-principles-for-building-sdks/)). Common developer pain points, such as navigating verbose documentation or dealing with inconsistencies, are likely identified and addressed more readily when the company's own developers are among the primary consumers of these tools. This internal feedback loop aims to create SDKs and quickstarts that are not just functional but also accelerate secure and effective implementation for all users.

### The Challenges of an Inward Gaze

While using one's own platform provides invaluable insights, it doesn't render a company immune to challenges or criticisms. The experience of internal teams, who possess deep familiarity with the product, might not always mirror that of external users, especially those with simpler use cases or less technical expertise.

Some users on platforms like Reddit have voiced concerns about Auth0's pricing complexity, finding it difficult to predict costs or feeling pushed towards more expensive enterprise plans as their usage grows ([Reddit, "Is Auth0 dead/coasting?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1j89fe5/is_auth0_deadcoasting_whats_the_work_environment/), [Stytch Blog, "Auth0 reviews"](https://stytch.com/blog/auth0-reviews/)). Others have found aspects of the platform to be overly complex for basic authentication needs or have reported frustrations with customer support responsiveness or the perceived stagnation of certain features, particularly post-Okta acquisition.

One user on Reddit noted an instance where "the deploy CLI was totally broken when I first tried to use it (by a recent Auth0 platform update that hadn't been coordinated)." While this points to an internal coordination issue rather than a flaw in the authentication product itself, it highlights how even companies focused on developer tools can experience internal process challenges that impact external users.

These criticisms don't necessarily invalidate the benefits of internal usage, but they do underscore the importance of continuously gathering diverse external feedback. A feature that works seamlessly for an internal team of security experts might still present usability hurdles for a small startup trying to implement basic login.

### Evolving with the Ecosystem

Auth0's journey, particularly its "API-first" approach and the development of features like "Teams" born from internal needs, demonstrates a strong commitment to leveraging its own identity solutions. This practice helps ensure their core platform is robust, scalable, and equipped with the features necessary for complex identity management scenarios. As part of Okta, the broader landscape of internal usage and product integration likely continues to evolve.

The balance lies in harnessing the deep technical understanding gained from internal application while actively seeking and incorporating the diverse perspectives of the global developer community. By doing so, Auth0 aims to provide an identity platform that is not only powerful enough for its own demanding use cases but also accessible and adaptable for the thousands of organizations relying on it to secure their digital interactions.
