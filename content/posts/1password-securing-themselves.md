In the world of digital security, trust is paramount. For a company like 1Password, which millions of individuals and over 165,000 businesses rely on to protect their most sensitive information, that trust is hard-earned and meticulously maintained. A significant, yet often unseen, part of this commitment comes from a deeply ingrained practice: 1Password employees are not just the creators of their renowned password and identity security platform; they are its daily, power users. This philosophy of "eating your own dogfood" is fundamental to how 1Password innovates, refines its user experience, and fortifies its industry-leading security.

### A Security-First Culture, Powered by Internal Use

1Password's entire ethos is built around robust security principles, including a zero-knowledge architecture where only the user has the keys to decrypt their data, and strong end-to-end encryption. As their [security page](https://1password.com/security) emphasizes, "Our dual-key model ensures that even we can't see exactly what you've saved in 1Password." This foundational commitment naturally extends to how the company itself operates.

It's a logical imperative: a company dedicated to securing digital identities must, first and foremost, ensure its own internal security practices are exemplary. And what better way to achieve this than by using the very tools they advocate for their customers? From developers and security teams to marketing, sales, and support staff, 1Password employees rely on their own product to:

* **Secure their own work credentials:** Accessing internal systems, third-party SaaS applications, and development environments.
* **Manage sensitive company data:** Utilizing shared vaults for team collaboration and secure information exchange.
* **Practice strong password hygiene:** Leveraging 1Password's generator for creating robust, unique passwords for all accounts.
* **Monitor for vulnerabilities:** Likely using features analogous to Watchtower for their internal accounts and systems.

This widespread internal adoption means that any friction in the user experience, any potential security gap, or any opportunity for improvement is likely to be encountered by an employee first.

### How "1Password on 1Password" Shapes the Product

While 1Password may not always use the specific "dogfooding" jargon in public-facing materials, the benefits of their extensive internal usage are clear and directly influence product development:

* **Real-World Feature Validation:** When 1Password develops new features—be it advanced sharing capabilities in 1Password Business, new functionalities in their browser extensions, or the rollout of cutting-edge technologies like passkey management—their own teams are among the first and most critical testers. They experience these features in the context of their daily workflows, providing invaluable feedback on usability and effectiveness.
* **Driving Usability and Simplicity:** One of 1Password's core tenets is making robust security simple to use. Employees trying to get their work done efficiently using 1Password will quickly identify any complexities or areas where the user interface could be more intuitive. This internal feedback loop is crucial for ensuring "the secure thing to do is also the easy thing to do."
* **Enhancing Business Features:** 1Password Business offers features like custom roles, security policies, advanced reporting, and integrations with identity providers (IdPs) like Okta and Entra ID. The needs of managing 1Password (the company) as a growing, globally distributed organization directly inform the development and refinement of these enterprise-grade capabilities. For example, the structure and permissions of "Employee Vaults," as described on their [support page](https://support.1password.com/employee-vault/), reflect a deep understanding of how individuals operate within a business account.
* **Strengthening Security Posture:** 1Password's own security team undoubtedly uses 1Password to manage access to critical infrastructure and sensitive data. This high-stakes internal use case provides a constant proving ground for its security architecture. Their commitment to regular third-party security audits and a significant bug bounty program complements this internal vigilance. As stated on their [MSP page](https://1password.com/managed-service-provider-security), 1Password has never been breached, and its design accounts for such possibilities.
* **Pioneering New Technologies like Passkeys:** As the industry moves towards passwordless solutions, 1Password is actively involved in the development and adoption of passkeys. Their [product page on passkeys](https://1password.com/product/passkeys) details their commitment to this future. It's highly probable that 1Password employees are among the earliest internal adopters and testers of passkey functionality within their own product, helping to refine the user experience and ensure seamless integration across devices and platforms. While challenges like passkey export standards are being worked on with the FIDO Alliance, as discussed in the [1Password Community](https://www.1password.community/discussions/1password/we-need-passkey-export-support-/83107), internal experiences would surely inform their contributions to these industry-wide efforts.

### The Feedback Loop: From Internal Users to Global Product

1Password fosters a strong connection with its user base through its active [1Password Community](https://blog.1password.com/1password-community-launch/), where users (including business administrators and developers) can share feedback, request features, and participate in beta programs. It stands to reason that employees are also active in these internal and external feedback channels, bringing their unique perspectives as both builders and users of the product.

The company's recent expansion into **Extended Access Management (XAM)**, as announced in their [press release on next-gen access security](https://1password.com/press/2025/april/new-extended-access-management-platform-capabilities), addresses the complexities of modern work where employees and AI agents operate across various platforms and devices, often outside traditional security perimeters. Developing such a comprehensive platform would necessitate deep internal understanding and testing of these diverse access scenarios.

### Benefits of the Internal Proving Ground

This commitment to using their own product offers significant advantages:

* **Enhanced Product Quality:** Bugs and usability issues are often caught and addressed earlier in the development cycle.
* **Deep User Empathy:** Employees develop a profound understanding of user needs and pain points.
* **Increased Security Confidence:** Vigorously using their own security product to protect their own company builds immense confidence in its capabilities.
* **Faster Iteration:** Internal feedback loops can accelerate the refinement of features and the response to emerging security threats.
* **Authentic Advocacy:** When employees genuinely use and trust the product they build, they become its most authentic advocates.

While it's important for any company "dogfooding" its products to also seek diverse external feedback to avoid developing in an echo chamber (as noted in general discussions of the practice, like on the [Splunk blog](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/dogfooding.html)), 1Password's strong community engagement and focus on a wide range of use cases (individual, family, small business, enterprise, developer) helps mitigate this risk.

### Conclusion: Trust Forged Through Use

1Password's position as a leader in the password management and identity security space is built on a foundation of strong encryption, user-centric design, and an unwavering commitment to security. A critical, though perhaps less visible, component of this success is the company's own extensive internal use of its products. By being its own most rigorous "customer zero," 1Password doesn't just build a security platform; it lives within it, constantly testing, refining, and ensuring it meets the highest standards—their own. This internal proving ground is a key reason why millions trust 1Password to protect their digital lives.
