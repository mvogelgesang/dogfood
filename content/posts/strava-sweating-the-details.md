Strava, the ubiquitous social network for athletes, has built its success on understanding what motivates cyclists, runners, and a multitude of other active individuals. A significant, yet perhaps less visible, part of that understanding comes from a powerful internal resource: its own employees. At Strava, the line between user and creator is often beautifully blurred. The company's culture not only encourages but often expects its team members to be active participants on the platform, creating a dynamic feedback loop that directly shapes the product from the inside out.

### A Culture Steeped in Activity and Authenticity

Strava's company values, often referred to as their "ABCs," paint a clear picture of this internal dynamic. "Authenticity" dictates that they "design with data insights, not assumptions. We use data, lived experiences, and feedback to guide decisions." "Balance" emphasizes that "We practice what we preach: there's always time for a workout." And "Camaraderie" highlights that "Culture is a team sport. Our best work comes when we honor each other's stories and strengths." These aren't just aspirational posters on a wall; they are lived principles that translate into a workforce deeply engaged with the product they're building.

As stated on their [careers page](https://www.strava.com/careers), Strava aims to build a team that reflects the world it serves, valuing "lived experiences." Perks like race entries and gear discounts further incentivize this active engagement. This means that when product managers, engineers, designers, and marketers at Strava are discussing new features or iterating on existing ones, many are doing so not just as professionals, but as daily, passionate users of the app.

Michael Horvath, one of Strava's co-founders, has often spoken about the importance of understanding the customer. In an interview with [Acquired.fm](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/strava-with-michael-horvath-and-mark-gainey) (Note: While a specific quote on internal dogfooding from this interview wasn't pinpointed in the search, the founders' athletic backgrounds and user-centric philosophy are well-documented), the genesis of Strava itself stemmed from their own desire as athletes to see and share their activities in a more compelling way. This foundational "build what you need" mentality naturally evolved into a "use what you build" culture.

### From Internal Kudos to Public Features: The Feedback Loop

While Strava might not use the formal "dogfooding" label extensively in public communications, the practice is evident. The "lived experiences" and "feedback" mentioned in their values translate into a continuous, informal, and sometimes formal, testing and iteration cycle driven by employees.

Consider the development of new features. Before any new functionality reaches the broader Strava community, it's highly probable that Strava employees are among the first to test it in their own workouts and daily routines. This provides invaluable early insights into usability, bugs, and overall appeal. An interview with Strava executives published on [Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-interview-athlete-intelligence-inaccurate-gps-race-leaderboards-and-more) regarding the "Athlete Intelligence" feature noted that for some sports, more internal testing might be needed before a feature is "fully baked," implying a rigorous internal validation process.

Strava also heavily relies on data analytics to inform product decisions, as detailed in a [case study with Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/blog/strava-analytics-efficiency). While this data encompasses the entire user base, the insights gleaned also benefit from an internal team that understands the nuances of athletic data because they are generating it themselves. This allows them to "find gaps in our product offerings, and build features and experiences that increase value."

The social features that are core to Strava's success—segments, leaderboards, clubs, kudos, and comments—are features that Strava employees themselves actively participate in. This direct engagement ensures that the evolution of these community-building tools is guided by people who genuinely understand their power and appeal.

### Benefits of an Athlete-Centric Development Team

This internal usage model offers several key advantages for Strava:

* **Authentic User Perspective:** Employees provide genuine insights as active users, understanding the desires and pain points of the core athletic community.
* **Rapid Iteration:** Issues can be identified and addressed quickly when the developers and designers are also the users.
* **Feature Relevance:** New features are more likely to resonate with the target audience because they've often been conceived or validated by a passionate internal user base.
* **Strong Company Culture:** A shared passion for activity and the product itself fosters a strong sense of camaraderie and commitment among employees. As highlighted on their [Comparably culture page](https://www.comparably.com/companies/strava), employees rate their team highly and look forward to interactions.

### Potential Blind Spots and Evolving Perspectives

While having a team of dedicated athletes using the product is a significant strength, it could also present challenges. A highly athletic and tech-savvy employee base might inadvertently develop features that cater more to the "hardcore" user, potentially overlooking the needs of beginners, more casual users, or those with different accessibility requirements.

Strava is aware of the need to serve a broad community. Their mission to "connect athletes to what motivates them and help them find their personal best" applies to everyone, regardless of their current fitness level. The ongoing evolution of the platform, including features designed for a wider range of activities and motivations, suggests an effort to address these potential blind spots, likely informed by broader user data and dedicated user research alongside internal feedback.

The company's engineering team, as seen on the [Strava Labs page](https://labs.strava.com/) and their [developer portal](https://developers.strava.com/), clearly innovates with their rich dataset. It's plausible that internal hackathons or employee-driven projects using their own APIs also contribute to new feature ideas or improvements, further embedding the "use your own platform" ethos.

### The Finish Line: A Product Shaped by Its People

Strava's success is intrinsically linked to its community, and that community starts within its own walls. By fostering a culture where employees are encouraged to be active users, Strava ensures a continuous flow of authentic feedback and "lived experiences" into its product development cycle. This approach doesn't just help them "sweat the details"—it helps them build a platform that genuinely understands and serves the needs of athletes worldwide, because, in many ways, they are building it for themselves.
