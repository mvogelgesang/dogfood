excerpt: "Okta doesn't just sell identity and access management; it lives it. By deploying its own solutions internally—a practice often dubbed 'Okta on Okta'—the company rigorously tests, refines, and validates its platform in a real-world, enterprise-grade environment. This commitment to being Customer Zero is fundamental to its innovation and security-first culture."

In the complex and critical world of identity and access management (IAM), trust and reliability are paramount. Okta, a leading independent identity provider, understands this better than most, not just as a vendor but as a primary user of its own comprehensive suite of solutions. The "Okta on Okta" philosophy—essentially "eating their own dogfood"—is a core tenet of their development process and security culture. By deploying its own products to secure its global workforce, manage access to thousands of applications, and protect its infrastructure, Okta gains invaluable firsthand experience that directly shapes the robustness, usability, and innovation of the platform it offers to its customers.

### Customer Zero: Deploying and Refining from the Inside Out

Okta doesn't just preach a security-first approach; it practices it internally, often making its own employees the first and most critical users of new features and products. A prime example is the internal deployment of **Okta Device Access**, a solution designed to enhance device security posture. In an insightful [Okta blog post titled "Insights from Our Experience: Okta deploys Okta Device Access,"](https://www.okta.com/blog/2025/04/insights-from-our-experience-okta-deploys-okta-device-access/) the company details its journey of rolling out Desktop MFA to its workforce.

The internal Okta technology team identified pilot groups, gathered user feedback, and refined support documentation throughout the deployment. The post explicitly states: "**Beyond improving our security posture, this experience proved an excellent opportunity to gather helpful feedback on the overall product design and user experience, which has helped inform the Okta Device Access roadmap.**" This is a clear demonstration of how internal challenges and successes directly translate into product improvements for external customers. The process helped find edge cases and informed future development, including new recovery flows to reduce support burden.

### The Okta Secure Identity Commitment: Leading by Example

Okta's commitment to internal adoption is further underscored by its **Okta Secure Identity Commitment**. This initiative, often championed by CEO Todd McKinnon, emphasizes a relentless investment in a defense-in-depth and Zero Trust security architecture—principles applied vigorously to Okta's own corporate infrastructure.

A key aspect of this commitment, as highlighted in an [Okta newsroom post](https://www.okta.com/en-nl/newsroom/press-releases/introducing-the-okta-secure-identity-commitment/), is "modeling security best practices to our customers." Okta proudly states: "**We have 100% of Okta employees using FastPass and phishing resistant passwordless authentication, and we encourage customers to do the same.**" By mandating strong authentication for its own workforce, Okta not only enhances its internal security but also validates the usability and effectiveness of its most advanced security features in a large-scale, real-world environment.

### Securing a Global, Hybrid Workforce with Okta

Like many of its customers, Okta operates with a globally distributed and often hybrid workforce. This makes its own internal environment a perfect proving ground for the entire Okta Workforce Identity Cloud, including:

* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Okta employees use Okta SSO to seamlessly and securely access the thousands of cloud and on-premise applications necessary for their daily work. This constant internal use helps refine the SSO experience, the Okta Integration Network (OIN) which boasts over 7,000 integrations, and the overall admin and end-user usability.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** As a leader in MFA, Okta ensures its own employees are protected by strong authentication methods. This internal deployment across a diverse user base helps them understand the practicalities of various factors and enrollment processes.
* **Universal Directory:** Managing identities for all its employees and contractors relies on its own Universal Directory, ensuring that features for provisioning, de-provisioning, and attribute management are robust and scalable.
* **Lifecycle Management:** The onboarding and offboarding of Okta employees are managed using Okta Lifecycle Management, streamlining IT processes and enhancing security. Experiencing these workflows internally helps identify areas for automation and improvement.
* **Advanced Server Access & API Access Management:** Protecting its own critical infrastructure and APIs with solutions like Okta Advanced Server Access and API Access Management allows Okta to understand the nuances of securing modern, ephemeral infrastructure and microservices from an operator's perspective.

### The Benefits of "Okta on Okta"

This deep internal reliance on its own products yields significant advantages:

* **Enhanced Product Quality & Security:** Rigorous internal use by a security-conscious workforce helps identify and remediate vulnerabilities and usability issues before they impact customers. Okta's [Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)](https://www.okta.com/sites/default/files/2025-02/Okta%20Secure%20Development%20Lifecycle_8.5x11_Whitepaper_FINAL.pdf) outlines comprehensive security practices, and using their own tools to secure this process adds another layer of validation.
* **Deep Customer Empathy:** Okta's product teams gain a profound understanding of the challenges IT and security professionals face when deploying and managing identity solutions. This empathy translates into more intuitive products and better customer support.
* **Faster Innovation Cycles:** The direct feedback loop from internal users allows for quicker iterations and refinements. New ideas and features can be prototyped and tested within Okta's own environment, accelerating the path to market.
* **Credibility and Trust:** When Okta showcases how it secures its own enterprise, it builds significant credibility with prospective and existing customers. They are not just selling a vision; they are living it. This is often a theme at their [Oktane conferences](https://www.okta.com/blog/2024/10/oktane-2024-the-future-of-identity-security/), where the company shares its own journey and learnings.

### Driving the Future of Identity Security

Okta's vision, as articulated by its leadership, is to free everyone to safely use any technology. By being its own most demanding customer, Okta puts its identity platform to the ultimate test every day. This internal proving ground ensures that as the threat landscape evolves and new identity challenges emerge (like securing AI agents and non-human identities, as mentioned in a recent [Okta platform innovations announcement](https://investor.okta.com/news-and-events/news-releases/news-details/2025/New-Okta-Platform-Innovations-Extend-Identity-Security-Fabric-to-Non-Human-Identities-in-an-Agentic-AI-Future/default.aspx)), Okta's solutions are not only keeping pace but are also shaped by the practical needs and security imperatives of a leading enterprise: itself. This commitment to "Okta on Okta" is a powerful driver of its leadership in the identity space.
