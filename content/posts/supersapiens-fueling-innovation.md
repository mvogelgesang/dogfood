In the demanding world of endurance sports, where marginal gains can make all the difference, understanding one's own physiology is paramount. Supersapiens, a sports technology company, has emerged with a singular focus: empowering athletes to optimize performance through real-time visibility of their glucose levels. But this isn't just a product they build and ship; it's a technology deeply embedded in the company's DNA, starting with its founder and permeating through a team passionate about athletic endeavor. The ethos of "eating your own dogfood" is palpable at Supersapiens, where internal use and firsthand experience are critical drivers in shaping their innovative energy management system.

### Born from Personal Experience: The Ultimate "User Zero"

The story of Supersapiens is intrinsically linked to the life of its founder, Phil Southerland. Southerland, who has lived with type 1 diabetes since infancy, has been a pioneer in utilizing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology, not just for health management but for athletic performance. His journey, which includes founding Team Novo Nordisk, the world's first all-diabetes professional cycling team, is a testament to the power of understanding and managing glucose. As he told [Rouleur](https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-performance/what-is-supersapiens-the-story-behind-the-next-frontier-in-performance), "I've been using the technology in Supersapiens in one form or another for 15 years now... It works, not only for diabetics like myself, but for every rider.”

This decades-long personal reliance on CGM technology makes Southerland the ultimate "user zero." His deep, lived experience directly informed the vision for Supersapiens: to make this powerful data accessible and actionable for all athletes seeking a performance edge. The company's mission, as stated on its [website](https://www.supersapiens.com/our-story), is to "unlock human potential" by delivering "the best insights for lasting positive behaviour change and performance improvements" through glucose stability.

### A Team of Athletes, A Culture of Use

Given its focus on athletic performance, it's no surprise that Supersapiens attracts employees who are themselves dedicated athletes. While specific internal programs aren't heavily publicized, the company culture inherently encourages the use of its own product—the Abbott Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biosensor paired with the Supersapiens app and wearables. When your colleagues are also your target audience, the feedback loop becomes incredibly direct and insightful.

Engineers, product managers, marketers, and support staff who are cyclists, runners, triathletes, or engaged in other endurance pursuits can test new features, identify pain points, and validate the utility of glucose data in their own training and recovery. This isn't just about quality assurance; it's about deeply understanding the user journey and the nuances of how glucose data can inform fueling strategies, energy management during exertion, and recovery protocols.

The Supersapiens system, which provides minute-by-minute glucose data, aims to help athletes "prime, perform, and recover" more effectively. It's easy to imagine internal discussions and product development meetings at Supersapiens being rich with personal anecdotes and data from employees' own recent workouts or races, directly influencing how features are prioritized and designed.

### Refining the Product Through Firsthand Insights

The impact of this internal usage can be seen in several aspects of the Supersapiens ecosystem:

* **Actionable Insights:** The Supersapiens app isn't just about displaying raw glucose numbers; it's about providing context and guidance. The development of "glucose performance zones" and insights into how different foods and training intensities affect glucose levels are likely refined through countless hours of internal experimentation and data analysis.
* **User Experience (UX) and App Development:** Athletes using their own app during grueling training sessions or in the blur of competition will quickly identify any UI clumsiness or data presentation issues. The need for quick, at-a-glance information on the Supersapiens Energy Band or integrated Garmin and Wahoo devices ([Supersapiens Integrations](https://www.supersapiens.com/integrations)) becomes crystal clear when you're the one trying to make fueling decisions mid-race.
* **Hardware Integration and Reliability:** Ensuring seamless Bluetooth connectivity between the biosensor, the app, and third-party devices is critical. Internal testing by employees across various devices and real-world conditions helps identify and iron out potential connectivity issues. Reviews, such as one on [Rouleur about the Energy Band](https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-performance/supersapiens-energy-band-the-worlds-first-real-time-glucose-monitor), often highlight the practicalities of using such devices, areas that internal users would also experience and push to improve.
* **Educational Content and Support:** Understanding how to interpret glucose data is key for athletes. The questions, challenges, and "aha!" moments experienced by employees using the system likely inform the educational content and support materials Supersapiens provides to its broader user base.

Supersapiens also collaborates closely with elite athletes and professional teams, such as [Team Jumbo-Visma (now Team Visma | Lease a Bike)](https://www.endurancesportswire.com/supersapiens-and-team-jumbo-visma-extend-partnership/). While this provides invaluable data and insights from the highest level of sport, the day-to-day experiences of a broader range of athletic employees can offer a complementary perspective, helping to ensure the product is relatable and beneficial for dedicated age-groupers and serious amateurs as well.

### Potential Considerations: The Elite Athlete Focus

One consideration for a company so deeply embedded in high-performance athletics is ensuring that the product and its messaging also resonate with athletes who may not be at an elite level but are still serious about their performance and health. If the internal user base is predominantly composed of highly conditioned, extremely data-literate athletes, there's a potential for features or data interpretations to become overly complex for those newer to CGM technology or less experienced in endurance sports.

However, the very nature of CGM data – its personal and revelatory insights into how an individual’s body responds to fuel and effort – has a broad appeal. The key is translating complex physiological data into simple, actionable advice, a challenge that internal usage by a diverse group of employee-athletes can help address.

### Conclusion: Living the Data, Leading the Way

Supersapiens is more than just a technology provider; it's a company born from a deep, personal understanding of metabolic health and athletic performance. Founder Phil Southerland's lifelong journey with CGM laid the groundwork for a culture where using and believing in the product is inherent. By having its own team of athletes actively monitoring their glucose, experimenting with fueling strategies, and pushing their own performance boundaries with their system, Supersapiens ensures its product is not just theoretically sound, but practically effective and constantly refined by those who understand its potential most intimately. This commitment to "living the data" is a powerful driver in their mission to help athletes everywhere unlock their full potential.
